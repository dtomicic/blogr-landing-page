## Project task
Project task was to build a landing page following the design provided.

## Project overview
In this project I had a bit of a problem with the design and pictures whose half is positioned outside of the viewport but managed to find my way around it. The website could use some more tweaking with the said pictures and sections which display somewhat correctly but not all the way true to design. Also font sizes and image sizes could use a little bit of editing to make it appear better on bigger screens.

## Built with
- HTML
- SCSS
